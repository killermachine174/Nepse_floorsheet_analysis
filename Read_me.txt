The order in which the files should be run are as follows:
1) 24th Sept 2019 - to scrape data for a particular day (use fake useragent to remain anonymous)
2) If needed: run to adjust date
3) To put files in Mongo
4) Retreive from Mongo files
5) To make a list of broker's list run Broker_list_scrape
6) To find out shady brokers use the find_least_transaction_broker.py
